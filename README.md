## Overview

FilmArchive is a full-stack website designed to create a community amongst film lovers and enthusiasts. The project is centered around the review and comment functionality which was the initial idea for the project. The reviews aspect of the project allows users to create a review on any film of their choosing and share it. Users are also able to comment on any reviews they find interesting as a way to interact with others. Each user has access to a profile which they are able to add an avatar and a bio. The profile is also a location where users are able to see the reviews they have made as well as their watch later section. By default reviews are saved to the users profile allowing them to easily be managed and acts as a way to track films that have been watched. Furthermore, films can be added to a watch later list if users see any films that peak their interest and want to remember them for the next time they are looking for a film to watch.
