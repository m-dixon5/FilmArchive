## Overview

FilmArchive is a full-stack website designed to create a community amongst film lovers and enthusiasts. The project is centered around the review and comment functionality which was the initial idea for the project. The reviews aspect of the project allows users to create a review on any film of their choosing and share it. Users are also able to comment on any reviews they find interesting as a way to interact with others. Each user has access to a profile which they are able to add an avatar and a bio. The profile is also a location where users are able to see the reviews they have made as well as their watch later section. By default reviews are saved to the users profile allowing them to easily be managed and acts as a way to track films that have been watched. Furthermore, films can be added to a watch later list if users see any films that peak their interest and want to remember them for the next time they are looking for a film to watch.

### Agile and MoSCoW Prioritization

Throughout the process of creating the project Agile planning methods were used. Using a GitHub project board I was able to map out the website features / user stories. In addition, the tasks were placed into one of three categories : Todo, In Progess and Done which allowed me track each task. This in turn gave me a good reference point for the overall progression of the project at different stages, which I found useful. MoSCoW Prioritization was used alongside this to split up tasks / user stories into either : Must Have, Should Have, Could Have or Won't have. This allowed for a clearer plan and to understand what tasks needed to be completed in order to achieve the MVP.

### Entity Relationship Digram

Before starting the project an Entity Relationship Diagram was created in order to map out the database and to visualise how each table would interact with one another. I first created each table with all the neccessary key and field pairs using pen and paper. After I was happy that all fields and models were covered I moved on to determining the relationship each table had with another. To finalise everything I converted everything I had written down into Lucid Chart (see images below).
